// Whenever you are adding anything to an existing file, you are changing the version and creating new version. Version control is a version management system used to track the different versions of codes that is being born each time we work on the code on the code base.

// Types of Version Control System
// 1. Centralised Version Control System : A copy is kept in a central server
// 2. Decentralised Version Control System : A copy is kept on each engineer's code base.

// GitHub is where we keep everything that is being managed using Git.

// git add . : To track the changes files in our project folder
// git commit : To commit our changes
// git commit -m : To let us know where we commit the new changes
// git log : will show us the history of our commit
// git push : To push everything saved on our local laptop storage to the remote repository on github. We have git push -u origin master or git push -u origin main
